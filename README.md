## üõ†Ô∏è Get DiaSync Up and Running!

Ready to take control of your diabetes? Follow these simple steps to set up DiaSync on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
* **npm** or **Yarn**
* A **MongoDB** instance (local or cloud-hosted like MongoDB Atlas)
* A **Google Cloud Project** with the **Gemini API enabled** and your shiny new **API Key**.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Magic!**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace with your repo URL
    cd diasync
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (The Brains)**

    Navigate into the `backend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

    Now, create a file named `.env` in the `backend` directory and fill it with your credentials:

    ```env
    MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
    JWT_SECRET="a_super_secret_key_for_jwt_security"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key_here"
    NODE_ENV=development # Set to 'production' for deployment
    FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173" # Or your production frontend URL
    ```

    * Remember to replace the placeholder values with your actual connection strings and keys!

3.  **Frontend Setup (The Beauty)**

    Hop back to the main `diasync` directory, then dive into `frontend`:

    ```bash
    cd ../ # If you are still in backend
    cd frontend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

    Create another `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:

    ```env
    VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:5000" # Important for connecting to your local backend
    # If using Create React App, it would be REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:5000"
    ```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Let's Get It Running!

1.  **Fire Up the Backend!**

    From the `backend` directory, run:

    ```bash
    npm start # Or use 'node index.js'
    ```

    You'll see a message indicating the server is happily running on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Launch the Frontend!**

    From the `frontend` directory, kick off the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev # For Vite projects
    # Or 'npm start' if you used Create React App
    ```

    Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:5173`, and you'll be greeted by DiaSync!
